# How to contribute to BYInternet

## **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/lucasctrl/BYInternet/issues).
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/lucasctrl/BYInternet/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

## **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of the bot will generally not be accepted.

## **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/lucasctrl/BYInternet/issues) and start writing code.

## **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about the project on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/nEDcagb).

## **Branches naming convention**

Your branches should be named as follows:
`type/camelCase`

* **type**: represent the type of your feature, follow the following table
* **camelCase**: your feature title in [camelCase aka dromedaryCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) (e.g.: `i18nIntegration`, `responsiveSupport`, `pwaSupport`, ...)

If your branch does not follow this naming standard, your PR may be rejected.
